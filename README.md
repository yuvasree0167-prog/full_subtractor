AIM:

To design a Full Subtractor circuit and verify its truth table in Quartus using Verilog programming.

Equipments Required:

Hardware – PCs, Cyclone II , USB flasher

Software – Quartus prime

Full Subtractor

A full subtractor is a combinational circuit that performs subtraction involving three bits, namely minuend, subtrahend, and borrow-in . It accepts three inputs: minuend, subtrahend and a borrow bit and it produces two outputs: difference and borrow.
 
Diff = A ⊕ B ⊕ Bin
Borrow out = A'Bin + A'B + BBin
Truthtable

Program:

/* Program to design a half subtractor and full subtractor circuit and verify its truth table in quartus using Verilog programming. Developed by:YUVASREE S RegisterNumber:25014102 */
RTL Schematic
Output Timing Waveform

Result:
Thus, the Full Adder and Full Subtractor circuits are designed and the truth tables is verified using Quartus software.
